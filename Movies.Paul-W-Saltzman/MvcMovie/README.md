# MvcMovie

### Introduction
Welcome to the wonderful world of MVC. You should be excited! Model-View-Controller is one of the most widely used design patterns in web development. 
The concepts you’ll learn apply to any language or framework, not just C#. You’ll be thinking MVC on a daily basis when you get a job.

.NET provides three solutions for full-stack development: Razor Pages, Blazor and MVC. MVC is by far the most popular and it’s widely used in enterprise. 
While Blazor is gaining ground and more .NET teams are starting to use it, chances are you’ll have to write and/or maintain MVC code at some stage in 
your career.

For this initial tutorial we’ll be using the official documentation. Its MVC tutorial does a very good job at explaining the basic concepts. 
There will be a bit of hand-holding at first. You’ll be using .NET’s “scaffolding” (Scaffolding in ASP.NET Core is a technique used to generate 
code at design time to support a number of common application scenarios when working with Entity Framework Core), which is necessary given the 
slight complexity of the project, but if you pay attention to each line of code, by the end of this project you’ll have a good grasp of MVC basics.

### Requirements
- [x] This is an application to manage information about movies.
- [x] Users should be able to Add, Delete, Update and Read from a database, using website as the front-end.
- [x] You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.
- [x] There needs to be a search functionality where I can search movies by name.
- [x] You should use SQL Server, not SQLite.

### Notes
I'm really enjoying ASP.net.  I'll have to see what the newer dot net frameworks have to bring to the table.
